Introduction
============

This document defines the grammar formalism *Labelled BNF* (LBNF), which
is used in the compiler construction tool *BNF Converter*. Given a
grammar written in LBNF, the BNF Converter produces a complete compiler
front end (up to, but excluding, type checking), i.e. a lexer, a parser,
and an abstract syntax definition. Moreover, it produces a
pretty-printer and a language specification in LaTeX, as well as a
template file for the compiler back end. Since LBNF is purely
declarative, these files can be generated in any programming language
that supports appropriate compiler front-end tools. As of Version 2.0,
code can be generated in Haskell, Java, C++, and C. This document
describes the LBNF formalism independently of code generation, and is
aimed to serve as a manual for grammar writers.

A first example of LBNF grammar
===============================

As the first example of LBNF, consider a triple of rules defining
addition expressions with “1”:

::

      EPlus. Expr   ::= Expr "+" Number ;
      ENum.  Expr   ::= Number ;
      NOne.  Number ::= "1" ;

Apart from the *labels*, EPlus, ENum, and NOne, the rules are ordinary
BNF rules, with terminal symbols enclosed in double quotes and
nonterminals written without quotes. The labels serve as *constructors*
for syntax trees.

From an LBNF grammar, the BNF Converter extracts an *abstract
syntax* and a *concrete syntax*. In Haskell, for instance, the abstract
syntax is implemented as a system of datatype definitions

::

      data Expr   = EPlus Expr Number | ENum Number
      data Number = NOne

For other languages—C, C++, and Java—an equivalent representation is
given, following the methodology defined in Appel’s books series *Modern
compiler implementation in ML/Java/C*\  [1]_. The concrete syntax is
implemented by the lexer, parser and pretty-printer algorithms, which
are defined in other generated program modules.

LBNF in a nutshell
==================

Basic LBNF
----------

Briefly, an LBNF grammar is a BNF grammar where every rule is given a
label. The label is used for constructing a syntax tree whose subtrees
are given by the nonterminals of the rule, in the same order.

More formally, an LBNF grammar consists of a collection of rules, which
have the following form (expressed by a regular expression; Appendix
gives a complete BNF definition of the notation)::

  Ident "." Ident "::=" (Ident | String)* ";" ;

The first identifier is the *rule
label*, followed by the *value category*. On the right-hand side of the
production arrow (``::=``) is the list of production items. An item is
either a quoted string (*terminal*) or a category symbol
(*non-terminal*). A rule whose value category is :math:`C` is also
called a *production* for :math:`C`.

Identifiers, that is, rule names and category symbols, can be chosen *ad
libitum*, with the restrictions imposed by the target language. To
satisfy Haskell, and C and Java as well, the following rule is imposed:

.. highlights::
    An identifier is a nonempty sequence of letters, starting with a capital
    letter.

Additional features
-------------------

Basic LBNF as defined above is clearly sufficient for defining any
context-free language. However, it is not always convenient to define a
programming language purely with BNF rules. Therefore, some additional
features are added to LBNF: abstract syntax conventions, lexer rules,
pragmas, and macros. These features are treated in the subsequent
sections.

Section :ref:`conventions` explains *abstract syntax conventions*. Creating
an abstract syntax by adding a node type for every BNF rule may
sometimes become too detailed, or cluttered with extra structures. To
remedy this, we have identified the most common problem cases, and added
to LBNF some extra conventions to handle them.

Section :ref:`lexer` explains *lexer rules*. Some aspects of a language
belong to its lexical structure rather than its grammar, and are more
naturally described by regular expressions than by BNF rules. We have
therefore added to LBNF two rule formats to define the lexical
structure: *tokens* and *comments*.

Section :ref:`pragmas` explains *pragmas*. Pragmas are rules instructing the
BNFC grammar compiler to treat some rules of the grammar in certain
special ways: to reduce the number of *entrypoints* or to treat some
syntactic forms as *internal* only.

Section :ref:`macros` explains *macros*. Macros are syntactic sugar for
potentially large groups of rules and help to write grammars concisely.
This is both for the writer’s and the reader’s convenience; among other
things, macros naturally force certain groups of rules to go together,
which could otherwise be spread arbitrarily in the grammar.

Section :ref:`layout` explains *layout syntax*, which is a non-context-free
feature present in some programming languages. LBNF has a set of rule
formats for defining a limited form of layout syntax. It works as a
preprocessor that translates layout syntax into explicit structure
markers.

.. _conventions:

Abstract syntax conventions
===========================


Predefined basic types
----------------------

The first convention are predefined basic types. Basic types, such as
integer and character, can of course be defined in a labelled BNF, for
example:

::

      Char_a. Char ::= "a" ;
      Char_b. Char ::= "b" ;

This is, however, cumbersome and inefficient. Instead, we have decided
to extend our formalism with predefined basic types, and represent their
grammar as a part of lexical structure. These types are the following,
as defined by LBNF regular expressions (see [reg] for the regular
expression syntax):

* ``Integer`` of integers, defined ``digit+``
* ``Double`` of floating point numbers, defined
  ``digit+ '.' digit+ ('e' '-'? digit+)?``
* ``Char`` of characters (in single quotes), defined
  ``'\'' ((char - ["'\\"]) | ('\\' ["'\\nt"])) '\''``
* ``String`` of strings (in double quotes), defined
  ``'"' ((char - ["\"\\"]) | ('\\' ["\"\\nt"]))* '"'``
* ``Ident`` of identifiers, defined ``letter (letter | digit | '_' | '\'')*``

In the abstract syntax, these types are represented as corresponding
types of each language, except ``Ident``, for which no such type exists. It
is treated by a ``newtype`` in Haskell,::

      newtype Ident = Ident String

as ``String`` in Java, and as a ``typedef`` to ``char\*`` in C and C++.

As the names of the types suggest, the lexer produces high-precision
variants, for integers and floats. Authors of applications can truncate
these numbers later if they want to have low precision instead.

Predefined categories may not have explicit productions in the grammar,
since this would violate their predefined meanings.

Semantic dummies
----------------

Sometimes the concrete syntax of a language includes rules that make no
semantic difference. An example is a BNF rule making the parser accept
extra semicolons after statements:

::

      Stm ::= Stm ";" ;

As this rule is semantically dummy, we do not want to represent it by a
constructors in the abstract syntax. Instead, we introduce the following
convention:

.. highlights::
   A rule label can be an underscore \_, which does not add
   anything to the syntax tree.

Thus we can write the following rule in LBNF:

::

      _ . Stm ::= Stm ";" ;

Underscores are of course only meaningful as replacements of
one-argument constructors where the value type is the same as the
argument type. Semantic dummies leave no trace in the pretty-printer.
Thus, for instance, the pretty-printer “normalizes away” extra
semicolons.

Precedence levels
-----------------

A common idiom in (ordinary) BNF is to use indexed variants of
categories to express precedence levels:

::

      Exp3 ::= Integer ;
      Exp2 ::= Exp2 "*" Exp3 ;
      Exp  ::= Exp  "+" Exp2 ;
      Exp  ::= Exp2 ;
      Exp2 ::= Exp3 ;
      Exp3 ::= "(" Exp ")" ;

The precedence level regulates the order of parsing, including
associativity. Parentheses lift an expression of any level to the
highest level.

A straightforward labelling of the above rules creates a grammar that
does have the desired recognition behavior, as the abstract syntax is
cluttered with type distinctions (between ``Exp``, ``Exp2``, and ``Exp3``) and
constructors (from the last three rules) with no semantic content. The
BNF Converter solution is to distinguish among category symbols those
that are just indexed variants of each other:

.. highlights::
   A category symbol can end
   with an integer index (i.e. a sequence of digits), and is then treated
   as a type synonym of the corresponding non-indexed symbol.


Thus ``Exp2`` and ``Exp3`` are indexed variants of ``Exp``. The plain ``Exp``
is treated in the same way as ``Exp0``.

Transitions between indexed variants are semantically dummy, and we do
not want to represent them by constructors in the abstract syntax. To do
this, we extend the use of underscores to indexed variants. The example
grammar above can now be labelled as follows:

::

      EInt.   Exp3 ::= Integer ;
      ETimes. Exp2 ::= Exp2 "*" Exp3 ;
      EPlus.  Exp  ::= Exp  "+" Exp2 ;
      _.      Exp  ::= Exp2 ;
      _.      Exp2 ::= Exp3 ;
      _.      Exp3 ::= "(" Exp ")" ;

In Haskell, for instance, the datatype of expressions becomes simply

::

      data Exp = EInt Integer | ETimes Exp Exp | EPlus Exp Exp

and the syntax tree for ``2 * ( 3 + 1 )`` is

::

      ETimes (EInt 2) (EPlus (EInt 3) (EInt 1))

Indexed categories *can* be used for other purposes than precedence,
since the only thing we can formally check is the type skeleton (see the
section :ref:`typecheck`). The parser does not need to know that the indices
mean precedence, but only that indexed variants have values of the same
type. The pretty-printer, however, assumes that indexed categories are
used for precedence, and may produce strange results if they are used in
some other way.

.. hint::
   See Section :ref:`coercions` for a concise way of defining dummy
   coercions rules.

Polymorphic lists
-----------------

It is easy to define monomorphic list types in LBNF:

::

      NilDef.  ListDef ::= ;
      ConsDef. ListDef ::= Def ";" ListDef ;

However, compiler writers in languages like Haskell may want to use
predefined polymorphic lists, because of the language support for these
constructs. LBNF permits the use of Haskell’s list constructors as
labels, and list brackets in category names:

::

      [].  [Def] ::= ;
      (:). [Def] ::= Def ";" [Def] ;

As the general rule, we have

.. highlights::
   ``[C]``, the category of lists of type ``C``,

   ``[]`` and ``(:)``, the Nil and Cons rule labels,

   ``(:[])``, the rule label for one-element lists.

The third rule label is
used to place an at-least-one restriction, but also to permit special
treatment of one-element lists in the concrete syntax.

In the LaTeX document (for stylistic reasons) and in the Happy file (for
syntactic reasons), the category name ``[C]`` is replaced by ``ListX``.
In order for
this not to cause clashes, ``ListX`` may not be at the same time used
explicitly in the grammar.

The list category constructor can be iterated: ``[[X]]``, ``[[[X]]]``,
etc behave in the
expected way.

The list notation can also be seen as a variant of the Kleene star and
plus, and hence as an ingredient from Extended BNF.

In other languages than Haskell, monomorphic variants of lists are
generated automatically.

.. hint::
   See Section :ref:`terminator` for concise ways of defining lists by
   just giving their terminators or separators.

.. _typecheck:

The type-correctness of LBNF rules
----------------------------------

It is customary in parser generators to delegate the checking of certain
errors to the target language. For instance, a Happy source file that
Happy processes without complaints can still produce a Haskell file that
is rejected by Haskell. In the same way, the BNF converter delegates
some checking to the generated language (for instance, the parser
conflict check). However, since it is always the easiest for the
programmer to understand error messages related to the source, the BNF
Converter performs some checks, which are mostly connected with the
sanity of the abstract syntax.

The type checker uses a notion of the *category skeleton* of a rule,
which is a pair

.. math:: (C, A\ldots B)

where :math:`C` is the unindexed left-hand-side non-terminal and
:math:`A\ldots B` is the sequence of unindexed right-hand-side
non-terminals of the rule. In other words, the category skeleton of a
rule expresses the abstract-syntax type of the semantic action
associated to that rule.

We also need the notions of a *regular category* and a *regular rule
label*. Briefly, regular labels and categories are the user-defined
ones. More formally, a regular category is none of
``[C]``, ``Integer``, ``Double``, ``Char``, ``String`` and ``Ident``,
or the types
defined by ``token`` rules (Section :ref:`token`). A regular rule label is none
of ``_``, , ``(:)``, and ``(:[])``.

The type checking rules are now the following:

.. highlights::
   A rule labelled by ``_`` must have a category skeleton of form :math:`(C,C)`.

   A rule labelled by ``[]`` must have a category skeleton of form :math:`([C],)`.

   A rule labelled by ``(:)`` must have a category skeleton of form
   :math:`([C],C[C])`.

   A rule labelled by ``(:[])`` must have a category skeleton of form
   :math:`([C],C)`.

   Only regular categories may have productions with regular rule labels.

   Every regular category occurring in the grammar must have at least one
   production with a regular rule label.

   All rules with the same regular rule label must have the same category
   skeleton.

The second-last rule corresponds to the absence of empty data
types in Haskell. The last rule could be strengthened so as to require
that all regular rule labels be unique: this is needed to guarantee
error-free pretty-printing. Violating this strengthened rule currently
generates only a warning, not a type error.


.. _lexer:

Lexer Definitions
=================

.. _token:

The token rule
--------------

The token rule enables the LBNF programmer to define new lexical types
using a simple regular expression notation. For instance, the following
rule defines the type of identifiers beginning with upper-case letters.

::

      token UIdent (upper (letter | digit | '_')*) ;

The type ``UIdent`` becomes usable as an LBNF nonterminal and as a type in
the abstract syntax. Each token type is implemented by a ``newtype`` in
Haskell, as a ``String`` in Java, and as a ``typedef`` to ``char*`` in C/C++.

The regular expression syntax of LBNF is specified in the Appendix. The
abbreviations with strings in brackets need a word of explanation:

    ``["abc7%"]`` denotes the union of the characters
    '``a`` '``b``' '``c``' '``7``' '``%``'

    ``{"abc7%"}`` denotes the sequence of the characters
    '``a``' '``b``' '``c``' '``7``' '``%``'

The atomic expressions ``upper``, ``lower``, ``letter``, and ``digit`` denote the
character classes suggested by their names (letters are isolatin1).
The expression ``char`` matches any unicode character, and the
“epsilon” expression ``eps`` matches the empty string.  Thus ``eps`` is
equivalent to ``{""}``, whereas the empty language is expressed by ``[""]``.

.. note::
   The empty language is not available for the Java lexer tool JLex.

.. _postoken:

The position token rule
-----------------------

(As of February 7, 2011, only available for Haskell). Any ``token`` rule can be
modified by the word position, which has the effect that the datatype defined
will carry position information. For instance,

::

      position token PIdent (letter (letter|digit|'_'|'\'')*) ;

creates in Haskell the datatype definition

::

      newtype PIdent = PIdent ((Int,Int),String)

where the pair of integers indicates the line and column of the first
character of the token. The pretty-printer omits the position component.

The comment rule
----------------

*Comments* are segments of source code that include free text and are
not passed to the parser. The natural place to deal with them is in the
lexer. The ``comment`` rule instructs the lexer generator to treat certain
pieces of text as comments.

The comment rule takes one or two string arguments. The first string
defines how a comment begins. The second, optional string marks the end
of a comment; if it is not given then the comment is ended by a newline.
For instance, the Java comment convention is defined as follows:

::

      comment "//" ;
      comment "/*" "*/" ;

.. _pragmas:

LBNF Pragmas
============

Internal pragmas
----------------

Sometimes we want to include in the abstract syntax structures that are
not part of the concrete syntax, and hence not parsable. They can be,
for instance, syntax trees that are produced by a type-annotating type
checker. Even though they are not parsable, we may want to pretty-print
them, for instance, in the type checker’s error messages. To define such
an internal constructor, we use a pragma

::

      "internal" Rule ";"

where Rule is a normal LBNF rule. For instance,

::

      internal EVarT. Exp ::= "(" Ident ":" Type ")";

introduces a type-annotated variant of a variable expression.

Entry point pragmas
-------------------

The BNF Converter generates, by default, a parser for every category in
the grammar. This is unnecessarily rich in most cases, and makes the
parser larger than needed. If the size of the parser becomes critical,
the *entry points pragma* enables the user to define which of the
parsers are actually exported:

::

      entrypoints (Ident ",")* Ident ;

For instance, the following pragma defines ``Stm`` and ``Exp`` to be the only
entry points::

      entrypoints Stm, Exp ;

.. _macros:

LBNF macros
===========

.. _terminator:

Terminators and separators
--------------------------

The ``terminator`` macro defines a pair of list rules by what token
terminates each element in the list. For instance,

::

      terminator Stm ";" ;

tells that each statement (``Stm``) is terminated with a semicolon
(``;``). It is a shorthand for the pair of rules

::

      [].  [Stm] ::= ;
      (:). [Stm] ::= Stm ";" [Stm] ;

The qualifier ``nonempty`` in the macro makes one-element list to be the
base case. Thus

::

      terminator nonempty Stm ";" ;

is shorthand for

::

      (:[]). [Stm] ::= Stm ";" ;
      (:).   [Stm] ::= Stm ";" [Stm] ;

The terminator can be specified as empty ``""``. No token is introduced
then, but e.g.

::

      terminator Stm "" ;

is translated to

::

      [].  [Stm] ::= ;
      (:). [Stm] ::= Stm [Stm] ;

The ``separator`` macro is similar to ``terminator``, except that the
separating token is not attached to the last element. Thus

::

      separator Stm ";" ;

means

::

      [].    [Stm] ::= ;
      (:[]). [Stm] ::= Stm ;
      (:).   [Stm] ::= Stm ";" [Stm] ;

whereas

::

      separator nonempty Stm ";" ;

means

::

      (:[]). [Stm] ::= Stm ;
      (:).   [Stm] ::= Stm ";" [Stm] ;

Notice that, if the empty token ``""`` is used, there is no difference
between ``terminator`` and ``separator``.

**Problem**. The grammar generated from a ``separator`` without
``nonempty`` will actually also accept a list terminating with a
semicolon, whereas the pretty-printer “normalizes” it away. This might
be considered a bug, but a set of rules forbidding the terminating
semicolon would be much more complicated. The ``nonempty`` case is
strict.

.. _coercions:

Coercions
---------

The ``coercions`` macro is a shorthand for a group of rules translating
between precedence levels. For instance,

::

      coercions Exp 3 ;

is shorthand for

::

      _. Exp  ::= Exp1 ;
      _. Exp1 ::= Exp2 ;
      _. Exp2 ::= Exp3 ;
      _. Exp3 ::= "(" Exp ")" ;

Because of the total coverage of these coercions, it does not matter if
the integer indicating the highest level (here ``3``) is bigger than the
highest level actually occurring, or if there are some other levels
without productions in the grammar.

.. HINT::
   Coerced categorise (e.g. ``Exp2``) can also be used in other rules. For
   instance, given the following grammar::

     EInt. Exp2 ::= Integer;
     EAdd. Exp1 ::= Exp1 "+" Exp2;

   you might want to use ``Exp2`` instead of simply ``Exp`` to force the usage
   of parenthesis around non-trivial expressions.  For instance, ``Foo. F ::=
   "foo" Exp2 ;`` will accept ``foo 42`` or ``foo (1 + 1)`` but *not*
   ``foo 1 + 1``.

   You can even use coerced categories in lists and give them different
   separators/terminators::

     separator Exp "," ;
     separator Exp2 ";" ;


Rules
-----

The ``rules`` macro is a shorthand for a set of rules from which labels
are generated automatically. For instance,

::

      rules Type ::= Type "[" Integer "]" | "float" | "double" | Type "*" ;

is shorthand for

::

      Type_0.      Type ::= Type "[" Integer "]" ;
      Type_float.  Type ::= "float" ;
      Type_double. Type ::= "double" ;
      Type_3.      Type ::= Type "*" ;

The labels are created automatically. A label starts with the value
category name. If the production has just one item, which is moreover
possible as a part of an identifier, that item is used as a suffix. In
other cases, an integer suffix is used. No global checks are performed
when generating these labels. Any label name clashes that result from
them are captured by BNFC type checking on the generated rules.

Notice that, using the ``rules`` macro, it is possible to define an LBNF
grammar without giving any labels. To guarantee the uniqueness of
labels, productions of the each category must be grouped together.

.. _layout:

Layout syntax
=============

Layout syntax is a means of using indentation to group program elements.
It is used in some languages, e.g. Haskell. Those who do not know what
layout syntax is or who do not like it can skip this section.

The pragmas ``layout``, ``layout stop``, and ``layout toplevel`` define a *layout
syntax* for a language. Before these pragmas were added, layout syntax
was not definable in BNFC. The layout pragmas are only available for the
files generated for Haskell-related tools; if Java, C, or C++
programmers want to handle layout, they can use the Haskell layout
resolver as a preprocessor to their front end, before the lexer. In
Haskell, the layout resolver appears, automatically, in its most natural
place, which is between the lexer and the parser. The layout pragmas of
BNFC are not powerful enough to handle the full layout rule of Haskell
98, but they suffice for the “regular” cases.

Here is an example, found in the the grammar of the logical framework
Alfa.

::

      layout "of", "let", "where", "sig", "struct" ;

The first line says that ``"of"``, ``"let"``, ``"where"``, ``"sig"``,
``"struct"`` are *layout words*, i.e. start a *layout list*. A layout list is a
list of expressions normally enclosed in curly brackets and separated by
semicolons, as shown by the Alfa example

::

      ECase. Exp ::= "case" Exp "of" "{" [Branch] "}" ;

      separator Branch ";" ;

When the layout resolver finds the token ``of` in the code (i.e. in the
sequence of its lexical tokens), it checks if the next token is an
opening curly bracket. If it is, nothing special is done until a layout
word is encountered again. The parser will expect the semicolons and the
closing bracket to appear as usual.

But, if the token :math:`t` following ``of`` is not an opening curly
bracket, a bracket is inserted, and the start column of :math:`t`
(or the column after the current layout column, whichever is bigger)
is remembered as the position at which the elements of the layout list must
begin. Semicolons are inserted at those positions. When a token is
eventually encountered left of the position of :math:`t` (or an
end-of-file), a closing bracket is inserted at that point.

Nested layout blocks are allowed, which means that the layout resolver
maintains a stack of positions. Pushing a position on the stack
corresponds to inserting a left bracket, and popping from the stack
corresponds to inserting a right bracket.

Here is an example of an Alfa source file using layout:

::

      c :: Nat = case x of
        True -> b
        False -> case y of
          False -> b
        Neither -> d

      d = case x of True -> case y of False -> g
                                      x -> b
                    y -> h

Here is what it looks like after layout resolution:

::

      c :: Nat = case x of {
        True -> b
        ;False -> case y of {
          False -> b
        };Neither -> d

      };d = case x of {True -> case y of {False -> g
                                      ;x -> b
                    };y -> h} ;

There are two more layout-related pragmas. The layout stop pragma, as in

::

      layout stop "in" ;

tells the resolver that the layout list can be exited with some stop
words, like ``in``, which exits a ``let`` list. It is no error in the resolver
to exit some other kind of layout list with ``in``, but an error will show
up in the parser.

The layout ``toplevel`` pragma tells that the whole source file is a layout
list, even though no layout word indicates this. The position is the
first column, and the resolver adds a semicolon after every paragraph
whose first token is at this position. No curly brackets are added. The
Alfa file above is an example of this, with two such semicolons added.

To make layout resolution a stand-alone program, e.g. to serve as a
preprocessor, the programmer can modify the BNFC source file
``ResolveLayoutAlfa.hs`` as indicated in the file, and either compile it or
run it in the Hugs interpreter by

::

      runhugs ResolveLayoutX.hs <X-source-file>

We may add the generation of ``ResolveLayoutX.hs`` to a later version of
BNFC.

**Bug**. The generated layout resolver does not work correctly if a
layout word is the first token on a line.

.. _profile:

Profiles
========

This section explains a feature which is not intended to be used in LBNF
grammars written by hand, but in ones generated from the grammar
formalism GF (Grammatical Framework). GF supports grammars of
natural-languages and also higher-order abstract syntax which is
sometimes used for formal languages to define their static semantics.
The reader not familiar with these matters can skip this section.

The relation between abstract and concrete syntax in LBNF is the
simplest possible one: the subtrees of an abstract syntax tree are in
one-to-one correspondence with the nonterminals in the parsing grammar.
The GF formalism generalizes this relation to one in which permutations,
omissions, and duplications can occur in the transition from abstract
and concrete syntax. The way back then requires a rearrangement of the
subtrees, which involves unification in the case of omissions and
duplications. It is also possible to conceive some concrete-syntax
constituents as bound variables, as is the case in higher-order abstract
syntax. The recipe for doing this postprocessing can be compactly
expressed by a *profile*, which has a list of positions of each
argument. For instance, the profiles in basic LBNF look as follows:

::

      While ([],[0])([],[1])([],[2]). Stm ::= "while" "(" Exp ")" Stm Stm ;

That is, each abstract argument occurs exactly once in the concrete
expression, and in the same order. The syntax trees produced have the
form

::

      While Ext Stm Stm

The first components in each list of pairs are for variable bindings. An
example is the variable declaration rule

::

      Decl ([],[0])([[1]],[2]). Stm ::= Typ Ident ";" Stm ;

which creates the abstract syntax

::

      Decl Typ (\Ident -> Stm)

An (artificial) example of duplication would be

::

      IsAlways ([],[0,1]). Sentence ::= "a" Noun "is" "always" "a" Noun  ;

which produces trees of the form

::

      IsAlways Noun

and would accept strings like *a man is always a man*, *a bike is always
a bike*, but not *a man is always a bike*.

An optimization: left-recursive lists
=====================================

[leftrec]

The BNF representation of lists is right-recursive, following the list
conctructor in Haskell and most other languages. Right-recursive lists,
however, are an inefficient way of parsing lists in an LALR parser,
because they can blow up the stack size. The smart programmer would
implement a pair of rules such as

::

      [].    [Stm] ::= ;
      (:).   [Stm] ::= Stm ";" [Stm] ;

not in the direct way, but under a left-recursive transformation, as if
we wrote,

::

      [].         [Stm] ::= ;
      (flip (:)). [Stm] ::= [Stm] Stm ";" ;

Then the smart programmer would also be careful to reverse the list when
it is used as an argument of another rule construction.

The BNF Converter automatically performs the left-recursion
transformation for pairs of rules of the form

::

      [].  [C] ::= ;
      (:). [C] ::= C x [C] ;

where C is any category and x is any sequence of terminals (possibly
empty). These rules can, of course, be generated from the terminator
macro (Section [terminator]).

**Notice**. The transformation is currently not performed if the
one-element list is the base case.

Appendix: LBNF Specification
============================

This document was automatically generated by the *BNF-Converter*. It was
generated together with the lexer, the parser, and the abstract syntax
module, which guarantees that the document matches with the
implementation of the language (provided no hand-hacking has taken
place).

The lexical structure of BNF
============================

Identifiers
-----------

Identifiers are unquoted strings beginning with a letter, followed by
any combination of letters, digits, and the characters \_ ’, reserved
words excluded.

Literals
--------

String literals  have the form :math:`x`, where :math:`x` is any
sequence of any characters except  unless preceded by ``\``.

Integer literals  are nonempty sequences of digits.

Character literals  have the form :math:`c`, where :math:`c` is any
single character.

Reserved words and symbols
--------------------------

The set of reserved words is the set of terminals appearing in the
grammar. Those reserved words that consist of non-letter characters are
called symbols, and they are treated in a different way from those that
are similar to identifiers. The lexer follows rules familiar from
languages like Haskell, C, and Java, including longest match and spacing
conventions.

The reserved words used in BNF are the following::

    char        coercions   comment
    digit       entrypoints eps
    internal    layout      letter
    lower       nonempty    position
    rules       separator   stop
    terminator  token       toplevel
    upper

The symbols used in BNF are the following::

    ; . ::=
    [ ] _
    ( : )
    , | -
    * + ?
    { }

Comments
--------

| Single-line comments begin with `--`.
| Multiple-line comments are enclosed with `{-` and `-}`.

The syntactic structure of BNF
==============================

Non-terminals are enclosed between ``<`` and
``>``. The symbols ``::=`` (production), ``::=`` (union) and ``ε`` (empty rule)
belong to the BNF notation. All other symbols are terminals.
