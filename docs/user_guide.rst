Generates java code

Entrypoints
...........

Cup can only generate parsers with a single entry point. If multiple entry points
are given using the ``entrypoint`` directive, only the first one will be used.
Otherwise, the first category defined in the grammar file will be used as the
entry point for the grammar.
If you need multiple entrypoints, use ANTLRv4.

ANTLRv4
.......

`ANTLRv4 <http://www.antlr.org/>`_ is a parser generator for Java.

With the ``--antlr`` option BNFC generates an ANTLRv4 parser and lexer.

All categories can be entrypoints with ANTLR: the ``entrypoint`` directive is 
thus ignored.

Make sure that your system's Java classpath variable points to an ANTLRv4 jar 
(`download here <http://www.antlr.org/download.html>`_)

You can use the ANTLR parser generator as follows::

    bnfc --java --antlr -m Calc.cf
    make

ANTLRv4 returns by default a `parse tree`, which enables you to make use of the 
analysis facilities that ANTLR offers.
You can of course still get the usual AST built with the abstract syntax classes
generated by BNFC.

From the ``Calc/Test.java``, generated as a result of the previous commands::

    public Calc.Absyn.Exp parse() throws Exception
    {
        /* The default parser is the first-defined entry point. */ 
        CalcParser.ExpContext pc = p.exp();
        // some code in between
        Calc.Absyn.Exp ast = pc.result;

The ``pc`` object is a ``ParserRuleContext`` object returned by ANTLR.

It can be used for further analysis through the ANTLR API.

The usual abstract syntax tree returned by BNFC is in the ``result`` field of 
any ``ParserRuleContext`` returned by the available parse functions 
(here ``exp()``).

Pygments
========

Pygments is not really a compiler front-end tool, like lex and yacc, but a
widely used syntax highlighter (used for syntax highlighting on github among
others).

With the ``--pygments`` option, BNFC generates a new python lexer to be used
with pygments.

Usage
.....

There is two ways to add a lexer to pygments:

* Fork the pygments codebase and add your lexer in ``pygments/lexers/``
* Install your lexer as a pygments plugin using setuptools

In addition to the lexer itself, BNFC will generate an minimal installation
script ``setup.py`` for the second option so you can start using the
highlighter right away without fiddling with pygments code.

Here is an example (assuming you've put the Calc grammar in the current
directory)::

    virtualenv myenv    # If you don't use virtualenv, skip the first two steps
    source myenv/bin/activate
    bnfc --pygments Calc.cf
    python setup.py install
    echo "1 + 2 - 3 * 4" | pygmentize -l calc

You should see something like:

.. image:: /calc-pygments.png

Here is the LBNF grammar highlighted with the pygments lexer generated from it:

.. image:: /lbnf-pygments.png

Caveats
.......

The generated lexer has very few highlighting categories. In particular, all
keywords are highlighted the same way, all symbols are highlighted the same way
and it doesn't use context (so, for instance, it cannot differentiate the same
identifier used as a function definition and a local variable...)

Pygments makes it possible to register file extensions associated with a lexer.
BNFC adds the grammar name as a file extension. So if the grammar file is
named ``Calc.cf``, the lexer will be associated to the file extension
``.calc``. To associate other file extensions to a generated lexer, you need to
modify (or subclass) the lexer.
