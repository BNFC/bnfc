   **************************************************************
    BNF Converter Module

    Description   : This module provides support for languages which need
                    named instance variables. (IE Java, C, C++) It provides
                    a data type to represent the name mapping and utility
                    functions to work with it.

                    Variables are grouped and numbered in a nice way.
