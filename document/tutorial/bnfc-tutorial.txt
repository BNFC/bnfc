==BNFC = BNF Converter==

BNF = Backus-Naur Form (also known as Context-Free Grammars).

BNF is the standard format for the
**specification** and **documentation** of programming languages.

BNFC makes BNF usable for **implementation** as well.

BNFC is a high-level front end to traditional implementation formats
(in the style of Lex and YACC):
//"BNFC is a compiler compiler compiler"//

BNFC saves 90% of source code writing in a typical compiler front end.

BNFC can be used for projects carried out in C, C++, C#, F#, Haskell, Java, OCaml.


#NEW

==What BNFC can be used for==

Strongest case: when designing and implementing a new programming language
- rapid development
- guaranteed consistency of components
- automatic documentation (in latex and html)
- freedom to change implementation language


BNFC also scales up to legacy programming languages
- Ansi C and Java have been implemented
- but some languages have rough corners (e.g. Haskell)


#NEW

==How to obtain BNFC==

BNFC homepage:
[``digitalgrammars.com/bnfc/`` http://digitalgrammars.com/bnfc/]

You can obtain
- a Windows binary
- a Linux (i386) binary
- a Mac OS X (i386) binary
- a source package


If you are using Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can obtain BNFC with their
package system (but it is a slightly older version).

For the binaries, it is enough to download them and put into a place where you
can find executables (such as ``/usr/local/bin`` on Unix-like platforms).


#NEW

==Working with BNFC sources==

If you choose the source package, you need the
[GHC Haskell Compiler http://www.haskell.org/ghc/]. With GHC in place,
just unpack the sources, ``cd`` to ``BNFC``, and type ``make``.

If you want to contribute to BNFC (more than 12 persons have!), you
can fork the [BNFC repository https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc] on github.com
and submit pull requests.

BNFC is licensed under GPL.


#NEW

==Calling BNFC==

When you have BNFC in place (i.e. on your path), you can call it via
```
  bnfc
```
This gives you a list of available options. The most common choices are:
```
  bnfc -m -c       FILE.cf      # to generate C
  bnfc -m -cpp_stl FILE.cf      # to generate C++ with STL
  bnfc -m -java1.5 FILE.cf      # to generate Java 1.5
  bnfc -m -haskell FILE.cf      # to generate Haskell
```
The ``-m`` flag makes BNFC to generate a ``Makefile``. This means
that, after running ``bnfc``, you can create an executable parser by
```
  make
```
Let us now create our first application from a BNFC source file.


#NEW

==My first compiler: calculator==

We start with everyone's favourite: the desktop calculator.

To make it the simplest possible, we restrict ourselves to integers, with
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and (lossy) division.

The input language is defined with the following BNFC grammar.
```
  EAdd. Exp  ::= Exp  "+" Exp1 ;
  ESub. Exp  ::= Exp  "-" Exp1 ;
  EMul. Exp1 ::= Exp1 "*" Exp2 ;
  EDiv. Exp1 ::= Exp1 "/" Exp2 ;
  EInt. Exp2 ::= Integer ;

  coercions Exp 2 ;
```
Copy this code into a file called ``Calc.cf``.

We return to the details of the notation after trying this out in BNFC.


#NEW

==Compiling the compiler in Java==

If you want to work in Haskell, C, or C++, skip a few sections now.

Assuming you want to work in Java, do the following:
```
  bnfc -m -java1.5 Calc.cf
  make
```
If everything goes fine, this will create a parser test class, which you
can try out in the following way:
```
  echo "23 + 4 * 70" | java Calc/Test

  Parse Successful!
  [Abstract Syntax]
  (EAdd (EInt 23) (EMul (EInt 4) (EInt 70)))
  [Linearized Tree]
  23 + 4 * 70
```
However, this will probably not work at first time: you will have to
install some more software and set a classpath.


#NEW

==Putting parser and lexer tools for Java in place==

When you called BNFC, you saw it generate lots of files. Most of them were
``.java`` files, but there were two special ones:
- ``Calc/Yylex``: lexer specification file in the JLex format
- ``Calc/Calc.cup``: parser specification file in the Cup format


You will need to download and install both of the required tools:
- [Cup http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/], version 0.10k
- [JLex http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/], version 1.2.6


It is safest to take the named versions,
even if there were newer ones available.

In addition to these, you of course need the Java compiler and runtime
environment available from [Sun http://java.sun.com].

Cup comes as a package of java and class files. Just unpack it in some
directory, e.g. ``/usr/local/java/Cup``.

JLex is just one Java file. Put it in some directory,
e.g. ``/usr/local/java/JLex``. Compile it with ``javac Main.java`` in that
directory.


#NEW

==Setting the Java class path==

After installing Cup and JLex, compiling with
```
  bnfc -m -java1.5 Calc.cf
  make
```
will probably still fail, with a message saying that a class was not found.
Fix this by
```
  export CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/java/Cup:/usr/local/java
```
provided you put Cup and JLex in places as specified above. Notice also the
inclusion of the current working directory (``.``).

If ``export`` doesn't work: in some Unix shells,
the ``CLASSPATH`` variable is set with the command
```
  setenv CLASSPATH .:/usr/local/java/Cup:/usr/local/java
```

//Now// you will hopefully be able to compile and run the compiler.


#NEW

==Compiling the compiler in Haskell==

Assuming you want to work in Haskell, do the following:
```
  bnfc -m -haskell Calc.cf
  make
```
If everything goes fine, this will create a parser test executable, which you
can try out in the following way:
```
  echo "23 + 4 * 70" | ./TestCalc

  Parse Successful!
  [Abstract Syntax]
  EAdd (EInt 23) (EMul (EInt 4) (EInt 70))
  [Linearized tree]
  23 + 4 * 70
```
The tools that you need to have installed are
- [GHC http://www.haskell.org/ghc/], the Glasgow Haskell compiler
- [Alex http://www.haskell.org/alex/], a lexer generator for Haskell
- [Happy http://www.haskell.org/happy/], a parser generator for Haskell



#NEW

==Compiling the compiler in C and C++==

Assuming you want to work in C or C++, do the following:
```
  bnfc -m -c Calc.cf           # in C
  bnfc -m -cpp_stl Calc.cf     # in C++
  make
```
If everything goes fine, this will create a parser test executable, which you
can try out in the following way:
```
  echo "23 + 4 * 70" | ./TestCalc

  Parse Successful!
  [Abstract Syntax]
  EAdd (EInt 23) (EMul (EInt 4) (EInt 70))
  [Linearized tree]
  23 + 4 * 70
```
The tools that you need to have installed are
- [GCC http://gcc.gnu.org/] compiler for C and C++
- [Bison http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/] parser generator for C and C++,
  version 1.875
- [Flex http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/] lexer generator for C and C++,
  version 2.5.4


The most common source of problems is wrong version of Bison. If the test
program always results in ``error: parse error``, check the version with
``bison --version``.





#NEW

==Content of a BNFC file==

A BNFC source file is a sequence of **rules**, where most rules have the
format
```
  LABEL . VALUE_CATEGORY ::= PRODUCTION ;
```
The ``LABEL`` and ``VALUE_CATEGORY`` are **identifiers** (without quotes).

The ``PRODUCTION`` is a sequence of
- identifiers, called **nonterminals**, and/or
- **string literals** (with quotes), called **terminals**.


The rule has the following semantics:

	A **tree** of type ``VALUE_CATEGORY`` can be built with ``LABEL`` as the
	topmost node, from any sequence specified by the production,
	whose nonterminals give the subtrees of this new tree.


Types of trees are the **categories** of the grammar. Tree labels are
the **constructors** of those categories.


#NEW

==Common problems with identifiers==

All categories and constructors should
- begin with a capital letter,
- contain only ASCII letters, digits, and underscores (``_``), and
- be distinct from each other.


These three conditions guarantee that the grammar
will work on //all// platforms.


#NEW

==Example of a tree==

In the examples above, the string
```
  23 + 4 * 70
```
was compiled into a tree displayed as follows:
```
  EAdd (EInt 23) (EMul (EInt 4) (EInt 70))
```
This is just a handy (machine-readable!) notation for the "real" tree

  [tuttree.png]

(You may also notice that it is //exactly// the notation Haskell programmers
use for specifying trees.)



#NEW

==Precedence levels==

How does BNFC know that addition is above multiplication? I.e., why isn't the tree
```
  EMul (EAdd (EInt 23) (EInt 4)) (EInt 70)
```
This is due to the fact that multiplication expressions are given
**higher precedence**.

The nonterminal ``Exp`` has **precedence level** 0 (actually, we could write
``Exp0`` to mean the same), ``Exp1`` has precedence level 1, etc.

The rule
```
  EAdd. Exp  ::= Exp  "+" Exp1 ;
```
says: ``EAdd`` forms an expression of level 0 from an expression of level 0
on the left of ``+`` and of level 1 on the right.

Likewise, the rule
```
  EMul. Exp1 ::= Exp1 "*" Exp2 ;
```
says: ``EMul`` form an expression of level 1 from an expression of level 1
on the left of ``*`` and of level 2 on the right.


#NEW

==Semantics of precedence levels==

An expression of higher level can always be used on lower levels as well.
- ``2 + 3`` is fine: level 2 (``EInt``) is used on levels 0 and 1, respectively.


An expression of any level can be lifted to the highest level by putting
it in parentheses.
- ``(5 + 6)`` is an expression of level 2.


The rule ``coercions Exp 2`` says that 2 is the highest level for ``Exp``.

All precedence variants of a nonterminal denote the same type.
- ``2``, ``2 + 2``, and ``2 * 2`` are of the same type, ``Exp``.


This means that a type-correct tree remains type-correct, if a subtree
of category ``Exp``//i// is changed into a subtree of ``Exp``//j//.



#NEW

==The deeper semantics of precedence levels: dummy labels==

BNFC permits a **dummy label**, which does not construct a new tree but
just returns the old one (which must be of same type):
```
  _. Exp2 ::= "(" Exp ")" ;
```
The rule (``coercions Exp 2``) is a shorthand for a group of dummy rules:
```
  _. Exp  ::= Exp1 ;
  _. Exp1 ::= Exp2 ;
  _. Exp2 ::= "(" Exp ")" ;
```


#NEW

==Compiler components==

BNFC generates the following components:
- lexer: the JLex/Alex/Flex file
- parser: the Cup/Happy/Bison file
- abstract syntax: a bunch of Java/Haskell/C/C++ files
- pretty printer: a Java/Haskell/C/C++ file
- back end skeleton: a Java/Haskell/C/C++ file
- grammar document: a Latex file


The first three belong to a **compiler front end**, analysing the source code.

The **compiler back end** can either
- generate some target code (compiler), or
- run the source code tree directly (interpreter).



#NEW

==Abstract syntax==

The hub of a modern compiler:
- target of the front end, and
- starting point of the back end.


In the middle of the front end and back end, there is manipulation of
abstract syntax, such as type checking and optimizations.

Abstract syntax representations in programming languages (as generated by BNFC):
- Haskell: algebraic datatypes
- Java and C++: classes and subclasses
- C: unions of structures



#NEW

==Abstract syntax in Haskell==

This is the most straightforward, so we start from it.

For every type in the grammar, a ``data`` definition is produced:
```
  data Exp =
     EAdd Exp Exp
   | ESub Exp Exp
   | EMul Exp Exp
   | EDiv Exp Exp
   | EInt Integer
    deriving (Eq,Ord,Show)
```
The ``deriving`` part says that the type ``Exp`` has equality and order
predicates, and its objects can be shown as strings.

The complete code is in the file
[``AbsCalc.hs`` calc/haskell/AbsCalc.hs].


#NEW

==An interpreter in Haskell: the tree traversal==

We write a program that parses an arithmetic expression and returns a
numeric value.

Here is the tree traversal: pattern matching on the type ``Exp``.
```
  module Interpreter where

  import AbsCalc

  interpret :: Exp -> Integer
  interpret x = case x of
    EAdd exp0 exp  -> interpret exp0 + interpret exp
    ESub exp0 exp  -> interpret exp0 - interpret exp
    EMul exp0 exp  -> interpret exp0 * interpret exp
    EDiv exp0 exp  -> interpret exp0 `div` interpret exp
    EInt n  -> n
```
The complete code is in the file
[``Interpreter.hs`` calc/haskell/Interpreter.hs].





#NEW

==An interpreter in Haskell: the main function==

We write a module reading string input calling ``Interpreter.interpret``.

The string is first lexed and parsed. The file
[``Interpret.hs`` calc/haskell/Interpret.hs]
is modified from
[``TestCalc.hs`` calc/haskell/TestCalc.hs].
```
  module Main where

  import LexCalc
  import ParCalc
  import AbsCalc
  import Interpreter

  import ErrM

  main = do
    interact calc
    putStrLn ""

  calc s =
    let Ok e = pExp (myLexer s)
    in show (interpret e)
```


#NEW

==Skeleton for tree processing in Haskell==

Recursive functions making case analysis on trees is used in almost all
components of the compiler.

BNFC gives a template for this, the **skeleton** file
[``SkelCalc.hs`` calc/haskell/SkelCalc.hs],
with a dummy tree processing function:
```
  transExp :: Exp -> Result
  transExp x = case x of
    EAdd exp0 exp  -> failure x
    ESub exp0 exp  -> failure x
    EMul exp0 exp  -> failure x
    EDiv exp0 exp  -> failure x
    EInt n  -> failure x

  type Result = Err String

  failure :: Show a => a -> Result
  failure x = Bad $ "Undefined case: " ++ show x
```


#NEW

==Compiling and running the interpreter in Haskell==

Compile with GHC:
```
  ghc --make Interpret.hs
```
Run on command-line input:
```
  echo "1 + 2 * 3" | ./Interpret
  7
```
Run on file input ([``ex1.calc`` calc/ex1.calc]):
```
  ./Interpret < ex1.calc
  9102
```
Now, if you are not working in Java, C, or C++, you can take a long leap.


#NEW

==Abstract syntax in Java==

For each category in the grammar, an abstract base class is generated.

For each constructor of the category, a class extending the base class.

This means quite a few files, put into the subdirectory
[``Calc/Absyn/`` calc/java/Calc/Absyn/]:
```
  Calc/Absyn/EAdd.java
  Calc/Absyn/EDiv.java
  Calc/Absyn/EInt.java
  Calc/Absyn/EMul.java
  Calc/Absyn/ESub.java
  Calc/Absyn/Exp.java
```

#NEW

==Inside the abstract syntax Java classes==


```
  public abstract class Exp implements java.io.Serializable {

  // some code that we explain later
  }

  public class EAdd extends Exp {
    public final Exp exp_1, exp_2;
    public EAdd(Exp p1, Exp p2) { exp_1 = p1; exp_2 = p2; }

  // some more code that we explain later
  }

  /* the same for ESub, EMul, EDiv */

  public class EInt extends Exp {
    public final Integer integer_;
    public EInt(Integer p1) { integer_ = p1; }
  }
```

#NEW

==Tree processing in Java: the Visitor==

For each category in the grammar, a Visitor interface and
an abstract accept method are generated.

For each constructor of the category, an accept method overriding the
abstract accept.
```
  public abstract class Exp implements java.io.Serializable {
    public abstract <R,A> R accept(Exp.Visitor<R,A> v, A arg);
    public interface Visitor <R,A> {
      public R visit(Calc.Absyn.EAdd p, A arg);
      public R visit(Calc.Absyn.ESub p, A arg);
      public R visit(Calc.Absyn.EMul p, A arg);
      public R visit(Calc.Absyn.EDiv p, A arg);
      public R visit(Calc.Absyn.EInt p, A arg);
    }
  }

  public class EAdd extends Exp {
    public final Exp exp_1, exp_2;
    public EAdd(Exp p1, Exp p2) { exp_1 = p1; exp_2 = p2; }

    public <R,A> R accept(Calc.Absyn.Exp.Visitor<R,A> v, A arg)
    {
      return v.visit(this, arg);
    }
```


#NEW

==The meaning of the Java Visitor==


``interface Exp.Visitor <R,A>``: collection of methods for
- visiting trees of type ``Exp``
- returning a value of type ``R``
- using an extra argument of type ``A``


``R accept(Exp.Visitor<R,A> v, A arg)``: a method for using a visitor and
returning a value

Recursive tree traversal:
- write a class that implements ``Exp.Visitor``
- override the default ``visit`` methods



#NEW

==An interpreter in Java: tree processing==

The program uses the visitor skeleton as basis, with ``Integer`` as return type
and ``Object`` as argument type (a dummy argument):
```
  private static class Calculator implements Exp.Visitor<Integer,Object> {

    public Integer visit(Calc.Absyn.EAdd p,Object o)
    {
      Integer a = p.exp_1.accept(this, null);
      Integer b = p.exp_2.accept(this, null);
      return a + b;
    }

    /* correspondingly for ESub, EMul, EDiv */

    public Integer visit(Calc.Absyn.EInt p, Object o)
    {
      return p.integer_;
    }
  }
```

#NEW

==Java code around tree processing==

The complete code is in the file
[``Interpreter.java`` calc/java/Calc/Interpreter.java]:
```
  package Calc;
  import Calc.Absyn.*;

  public class Interpreter {

    public static Integer interpret(Exp e)
    {
	Exp exp = (Exp)e ;
	return interpretExp(exp, null) ;
    }

    private static Integer interpretExp(Exp e, Object o)
    {
	return e.accept(new Calculator(), null) ;
    }

    private static class Calculator implements Exp.Visitor<Integer,Object> {

    // the tree traversal: see previous section
    }
  }
```


#NEW

==Tree processing in Java: the skeleton==

You can use the BNFC-generated file
[``Calc/VisitSkel.java`` calc/java/Calc/VisitSkel.java] as a template for
writing your own visitor applications:
```
  public class VisitSkel {
    public class ExpVisitor<R,A> implements Exp.Visitor<R,A> {
      public R visit(Calc.Absyn.EAdd p, A arg)
      {
        /* Code For EAdd Goes Here */
        p.exp_1.accept(new ExpVisitor<R,A>(), arg);
        p.exp_2.accept(new ExpVisitor<R,A>(), arg);
        return null;
      }

      public R visit(Calc.Absyn.EInt p, A arg)
      {
        /* Code For EInt Goes Here */
        //p.integer_;
        return null;
      }
    }
  }
```




#NEW

==An interpreter in Java: main class==

The program
[``Interpret.java`` calc/java/Calc/Interpret.java]
modifies the BNFC-generated
[``Test.java`` calc/java/Calc/Test.java],
by changing the tree output
to a call of the interpreter:
```
  public class Interpret {
    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception
    {
      Yylex l  = new Yylex(System.in) ;
      parser p = new parser(l, l.getSymbolFactory()) ;
      Calc.Absyn.Exp parse_tree = p.pExp() ;
      System.out.println(Interpreter.interpret(parse_tree)) ;
    }
  }
```
(We have omitted error handling.)



#NEW

==Compiling and running the interpreter in Java==

Compile with javac:
```
  javac Calc/Interpret.java
```
Run on command-line input:
```
  echo "1 + 2 * 3" | java Calc/Interpret
  7
```
Run on file input:
```
  java Calc/Interpret < ex1.calc
  9102
```


#NEW

==Abstract syntax in C==

Simpler than in Java but more complex than in Haskell.

For every type in the grammar, a structure containing a
tagged union of structures is created:
```
  struct Exp_ {
    enum { is_EAdd, is_ESub, is_EMul, is_EDiv, is_EInt } kind;
    union {
      struct { Exp exp_1, exp_2; } eadd_;
      struct { Exp exp_1, exp_2; } esub_;
      struct { Exp exp_1, exp_2; } emul_;
      struct { Exp exp_1, exp_2; } ediv_;
      struct { Integer integer_; } eint_;
    } u;
  };

  typedef struct Exp_ *Exp ;

  Exp make_EAdd(Exp p0, Exp p1);
  Exp make_ESub(Exp p0, Exp p1);
  Exp make_EMul(Exp p0, Exp p1);
  Exp make_EDiv(Exp p0, Exp p1);
  Exp make_EInt(Integer p0);
```
The complete code is in the files
[``Absyn.h`` calc/c/Absyn.h] and
[``Absyn.c`` calc/c/Absyn.c].



#NEW

==An interpreter in C: tree traversal==

We modify the skeleton (next section),
changing the return type and the name of ``visitExp``:
```
  int interpret(Exp _p_)
  {
    switch(_p_->kind)
    {
    case is_EAdd:
      return interpret(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_1) + interpret(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_2) ;
    case is_ESub:
      return interpret(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_1) - interpret(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_2) ;
    case is_EMul:
      return interpret(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_1) * interpret(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_2) ;
    case is_EDiv:
      return interpret(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_1) / interpret(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_2) ;
    case is_EInt:
      return _p_->u.eint_.integer_ ;
    }
  }
```
The complete code is in the files
[``Interpreter.h`` calc/c/Interpreter.h] and
[``Interpreter.c`` calc/c/Interpreter.c].


#NEW

==Tree processing skeleton in C==

The skeleton defines ``visit`` functions for all categories using
case analysis over constructor tags.
```
  void visitInteger(Integer i);

  void visitExp(Exp _p_)
  {
    switch(_p_->kind)
    {
    case is_EAdd:
      /* Code for EAdd Goes Here */
      visitExp(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_1);
      visitExp(_p_->u.eadd_.exp_2);
      break;

    /* similarly for other binary ops */

    case is_EInt:
      /* Code for EInt Goes Here */
      visitInteger(_p_->u.eint_.integer_);
      break;
    }
  }
```
The complete code is in the files
[``Skeleton.h`` calc/c/Skeleton.h] and
[``Skeleton.c`` calc/c/Skeleton.c].



#NEW

==An interpreter in C: main function==

The string is first lexed and parsed.

#NEW

==A larger source language==

We want to build a grammar of "C--", a fragment of C sufficient for
parsing the following Fibonacci program:
```
  // a fibonacci function showing most features of the CMM language

  int mx ()
  {
    return 5000000 ;
  }

  int main ()
  {
    int lo ;
    int hi ;
    lo = 1 ;
    hi = lo ;
    printf("%d",lo) ;
    while (hi < mx()) {
      printf("%d",hi) ;
      hi = lo + hi ;
      lo = hi - lo ;
    }
  return 0 ;
  }
```


#NEW

==List categories==

**Lists** are used everywhere in grammars. BNFC the category symbol
``[C]`` for a list of ``C``s.

Thus a program is a list of functions:
```
  Prog. Program ::= [Function] ;
```
A function has a list of declarations and a list of statements:
```
  Fun. Function ::= Type Ident "(" [Decl] ")" "{" [Stm] "}" ;
```

#NEW

==Terminators and separators==

Lists have **terminators** and **separators**:
```
  terminator Function "" ;
  terminator Stm "" ;
  separator Decl "," ;
```
The empty terminator ``""`` means the elements are just written next to
each other.

A list can be forced to have at least one element:
```
  separator nonempty Ident "," ;
```


#NEW

==Abstract syntax for lists==

Haskell: ``[C]`` is translated as ``[C]``

Java 1.5: ``[C]`` is translated as ``java.util.LinkedList<C>``

C++ with STL: ``[C]`` is translated as ``vector<C*>``

C: ``[C]`` is translated as a ``struct`` implementing the linked list
of ``C``.



#NEW

==Comments==

Comments are parts of source codes that the compiler ignores.

BNFC permits the definition of two kinds of comments: one-line and enclosed.

They are defined in the following ways for C--:
```
  comment "//" ;
  comment "/*" "*/" ;
```
Thus one-line comment definitions define the beginning of a comment, and
enclosed comment definitions the beginning and the end.

Commends are resolved by the lexer, using a finite automaton. Therefore
nested comments are not possible.


#NEW

==Complete grammar for C--==

```
comment "//" ;
comment "/*" "*/" ;

Prog. Program  ::= [Function] ;
Fun.  Function ::= Type Ident "(" [Decl] ")" "{" [Stm] "}" ;
Dec.  Decl     ::= Type [Ident] ;

terminator Function "" ;
terminator Stm "" ;
separator  Decl "," ;
separator  nonempty Ident "," ;

SDecl.   Stm ::= Decl ";"  ;
SExp.    Stm ::= Exp ";" ;
SBlock.  Stm ::= "{" [Stm] "}" ;
SWhile.  Stm ::= "while" "(" Exp ")" Stm ;
SReturn. Stm ::= "return" Exp  ";" ;

EAss.    Exp  ::= Ident "=" Exp ;
ELt.     Exp1 ::= Exp2 "<" Exp2 ;
EAdd.    Exp2 ::= Exp2 "+" Exp3 ;
ESub.    Exp2 ::= Exp2 "-" Exp3 ;
EMul.    Exp3 ::= Exp3 "*" Exp4 ;
Call.    Exp4 ::= Ident "(" [Exp] ")" ;
EVar.    Exp4 ::= Ident ;
EStr.    Exp4 ::= String ;
EInt.    Exp4 ::= Integer ;
EDouble. Exp4 ::= Double ;

coercions Exp 4 ;

separator Exp "," ;

TInt.    Type ::= "int" ;
TDouble. Type ::= "double" ;
```


#NEW

==Built-in token types==

These types are hard-coded and cannot be value types of rules:
- ``Integer``: sequence of digits, e.g. ``123445425425436``
- ``Double``: two sequences of digits with a decimal point in between,
  and an optional exponent, e.g. ``7.098e-7``
- ``String``: any characters between double quotes, e.g. ``"hello world"``
- ``Char``: any character between single quotes, e.g. ``'7'``
- ``Ident``: a letter followed by letters, digits, and characters ``-'``, e.g.
  ``r2_out'``


Precise definitions are given in the LBNF report.

#NEW

==Token definitions==

A grammar can define new token types by using regular expressions.
Here is an example of the format:
```
  token CIdent (letter (letter | digit | '_')*) ;
```
See LBNF report for more information.


#NEW

==Remembering the position of a token==

The position of a token can be passed to the syntax tree:
```
  position token CIdent (letter (letter | digit | '_')*) ;
```
See LBNF report for more information.



#NEW

==Common problems==

Java: CLASSPATH, should contain:
- the current directory ``.``
- Cup directory
- JLex directory

C and C++: Bison version, should be 1.875.

All grammars: conflicts. Use parser diagnosis tools to find and solve them!
